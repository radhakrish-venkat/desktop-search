# Security Analysis & Best Practices

## Summary
All major security recommendations have been implemented and tested. The codebase now includes:
- Index file integrity protection (SHA256, structure validation)
- Content validation for indexed files (suspicious pattern detection, MIME type verification)
- Google Drive token encryption (system keyring or file-based with cryptography)
- Sanitized logging (formatter redacts sensitive info)
- Secure error handling (sanitized context in logs)
- Security-focused tests (see `tests/test_security.py`)
- Security documentation and best practices

**All items in the security checklist are now complete.**

## Security Assessment Summary

### âœ… Secure Practices
- **No Code Injection**: No use of `eval()`, `exec()`, or shell commands
- **Input Validation**: Proper path validation using Click framework
- **File Size Limits**: 50MB maximum file size to prevent memory issues
- **Safe File Operations**: Proper encoding handling and temporary file management
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure Google Drive integration with minimal permissions
- **Automatic Initialization**: Secure certificate generation and component setup
- **Configuration Validation**: Automatic checking and creation of secure configurations

### Addressed Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Pickle Deserialization Risk
- **Mitigation**: Index files include a SHA256 integrity hash and structure validation. Tampering or corruption is detected and loading is blocked.
- **Reference**: See `pkg/indexer/core.py` (`save_index`, `load_index`, `_compute_index_integrity_hash`, `_validate_index_structure`).

#### 2. File Content Processing
- **Mitigation**: All file content is checked for suspicious patterns (XSS, scripts, etc). Only supported MIME types are processed.
- **Reference**: See `pkg/file_parsers/parsers.py` (`_validate_file_content`, `_get_file_mime_type`, `get_text_from_file`).

#### 3. Google Drive Token Security
- **Mitigation**: Google Drive tokens are encrypted using system keyring or file-based encryption (with `cryptography`). Fallback to plain text only if encryption is unavailable, with warnings.
- **Reference**: See `pkg/utils/google_drive.py` (`SecureTokenStorage`).

#### 4. Logging Security
- **Mitigation**: All logs are passed through a sanitizer that redacts sensitive paths, tokens, and secrets. Logging helpers ensure no sensitive data is leaked.
- **Reference**: See `pkg/utils/logging.py` (`SanitizedFormatter`, `log_file_operation`, `log_error_with_context`).

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Index File Security**: Keep index files in secure locations
2. **Google Drive Permissions**: Use dedicated service account with minimal permissions
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **File Validation**: Verify file sources before indexing

### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and audit for vulnerabilities
4. **Code Review**: Implement security-focused code reviews

### For Deployment
1. **File Permissions**: Set appropriate file permissions for index and token files
2. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for Google Drive API calls
3. **Access Control**: Limit access to sensitive directories
4. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting
